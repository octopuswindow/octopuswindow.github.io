        1 the lost factory. It was 1941 in Germany when a new factory
        Was created it was booming 29 years later they started to make
        Military products 1 months have passed it was exploded people where wondering
        Why and how it was exploded month later someone found a note
        And it said will a ever get money without working turns out
        He was trying to avoid his job of making tanks for war becase
        He did not want war. Every time you pass you will see a tank
        Pointing straight at you</p>
